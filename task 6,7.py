Title: Simple desktop calculator using Python. Only the five basic arithmetic operators.

AIM: Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

    User Input:
        Ask the user to enter two numbers, num1 and num2.
        Ask the user to enter a third number, num3.

    Addition:
        Add the first two numbers (num1 and num2).
        Print the sum in the format: "The sum of num1 and num2 is: result"

    Subtraction:
        Subtract num2 from num1.
        Print the difference in the format: "The difference when num2 is subtracted from num1 is: result"

    Multiplication:
        Multiply num1 by num2.
        Print the product in the format: "The product of num1 and num2 is: result"

    Division:
        Divide num1 by num2. Ensure that division by zero is handled properly.
        Print the quotient in the format: "The quotient when num1 is divided by num2 is: result"

    Modulus:
        Find the remainder when num1 is divided by num2.
        Print the remainder in the format: "The remainder when num1 is divided by num2 is: result"

    Combined Arithmetic Operation:
        Perform the following combined operation:
        result = (num1 + num2) * num3 / 2
        Print the result in the format: "The result of (num1 + num2) * num3 / 2 is: result"

Title: Create, concatenate, and print a string and access a sub-string from a given string.

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

    Create two separate strings:
        The first string should contain your first name.
        The second string should contain your last name.

    Concatenate the two strings with a space in between and store the result in a new variable.

    Print the concatenated string.

    From the concatenated string:
        Access and print a sub-string that consists of the last name only. Use string slicing to extract the sub-string.

Example:

If the first name is "John" and the last name is "Doe", the concatenated string should be "John Doe". The sub-string should be "Doe".
