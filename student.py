#The below lines of code shows how to collect input and print it.

name = input("Enter your Student name: ")                       #Here the input is taken as a string.
roll_no = int(input("Enter your roll number: "))                #Here the input is taken as an integer.
cgpa = float(input("Enter your cgpa here: "))                   #Here the input is taken as a float.
cgpa_percentage = cgpa*10                                       #The cgpa is converted to %value. This is possible since the datatype is integer.

print("Your name is ",name)
print("Your roll number is ",roll_no)
print("Your cgpa is ",cgpa)
print("Your cgpa percentage is",cgpa_percentage)


roll_no = roll_no + 100

print(roll_no)
